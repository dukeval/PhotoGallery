# Photo Gallery using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap and JavaScript.

First project for Eduonix Live MEAN course.  

I decided to use HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create the page template.  Then I used JavaScript to create the list of images to load and dynamically create the rows and columns with Bootstrap classes to make the page responsive.  Once an image is clicked, I passed the image title as query parameter to a new page that will load a full view of that image.

#### Project Description
You will have to create a photo album which consist of 3 rows and 3 columns of images. Each image should be properly spaced. The images should be clickable and clicking on it should show the image in a separate window.
